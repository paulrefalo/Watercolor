# Watercolor

iOS app used to keep inventory of M Graham watercolor paints (http://mgraham.com/products/watercolors/)
The app has all M Graham watercolor paints and pigments stored in core data.  Users can log into Facebook with
OAuth which will automatically log into Firebase and create a new user.  User's paint inventory and wishlist data
will be store both in core data and in backed up in Firebase.
